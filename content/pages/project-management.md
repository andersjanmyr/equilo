I am a positive, driven and structured Senior Project Manager, Coach and Entrepreneur with 20 years of experience within the IT industry.

My passion is to help people and organizations grow and deliver great results through pragmatic approaches where people take the central role. Processes and tools should support people and teams, not the other way around. Communication, and a bit of fun, is the key to make this work!

I have a wide experience of delivering IT projects, ranging from challenging complex global integration projects to internal process improvement projects, in several of the largest manufacturing companies in Sweden.

I lived in Silicon Valley for three years, during which time I experienced the challenging task of leading teams remotely from a different time zone.

I have been part of building organizations from scratch to refining already running ones. The project teams have often been multicultural and the language either English or Swedish.

One of my strengths is the ability to see the overall picture and, with a background as a developer and database administrator, understand the technical details as well. I tend to see how different changes will effect the projects and this allows me to take the necessary action to handle them. Flexibility and situation based work is essential.

I coach and mentor other Project Managers and Entrepreneurs who wants to either grow in their personal role or in their own business, from new startups to more mature companies.
