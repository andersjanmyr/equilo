      <description>I am a positive, driven and structured Senior Project Manager, Coach and Entrepreneur with 20 years of experience within the IT industry.
My passion is to help people and organizations grow and deliver great results through pragmatic approaches where people take the central role. Processes and tools should support people and teams, not the other way around. Communication, and a bit of fun, is the key to make this work!</description>
